> Describe and justify some of the key decisions you made in your project. Why did you decide to do what you did? How does your choice compare to the alternatives?

- This project was a fun exercise and demonstrates how I would tackle the problem given to me by HubSolv. The major key decision to make when completing this project was whether to use React or Vue as a framework. In the end I went with Vue, despite having very little experience in it so far. I chose to use Vue to show that I am not phased at the prospect of using new technologies and to hopefully convince the people at HubSolv that I am the right person for this job.

- I decided to make a movie database app for no reason other than I saw the API, I love movies, and thought it'd be good fun. IMDb is obviously a massively popular website, so I thought it'd be enjoyable to replicate something like that on a much smaller scale.

- I believe I made a good decision in not going with the alternative choices (Reddit or Twitter app) for two reasons. Firstly, becuase I spend enough time as it is on Reddit, and, secondly, because I firmly believe that the people on Twitter are too full of their own self-importance and I would rather not give them another platform to express their banal observations. There were of course tons of other APIs available to me, but I went with the movie database one and I'm happy with it. I enjoy movies!

> Describe in detail a few things you would have done differently if starting again. What was your rationale that led to the initial decision? What made you realise that a different option would have been a better choice? Why do you believe it to be a better choice?

- Choosing to use Vue in place of React was a risky decision for me to make not knowing the limits of what I'd know how to do with Vue. If I had to start again, knowing now what I know about Vue, then I'd potentially have gone for React instead, because I know that it would've been quicker for me to use React. I decided to go with Vue because of HubSolv's desire to hire someone who can demonstrate their ability with Vue. I don't believe using React would've been a better choice, just a different choice with its own pros and cons. I'm happy I went with Vue in the end because I was able to achieve a lot of what I'd set out to.

> Describe in detail a few things you would have done had you more time. How would this addition/change benefit the application? What negative impact, if any, does its absence have on the application?

- There's always room to improve an app, especially where user interaction is concerned. If I had more time, I would like to have added an autocomplete, or a function which returns possible choices once the user begins typing in the movie name. I'd also like to have the ability for the app to search for the movies without the need to click submit. Similar to the way Netflix's search works.

- This would've improved the app by making searching easier for the user.

- Negative impact might be that unless you're used to using a search like that, it could be confusing.
